                <p>Hundreds of thousands of homes near the Bangladesh-India border are underwater, and in the worst-hit
                    areas whole neighborhoods have been submerged. That's why we are giving food to them who are in
                    need.

                <p>Roads leading to the region have been largely cut off and there are power cuts even in areas not
                    underwater. They need proper shelter and we are helping those people by giving shelter.</p>

            <p>Being trapped and surrounded by deep flood water means people are unable to access basic essentials, and
                the little supplies they do have are quickly running out. The strong winds and heavy rain continue to
                put lives and property at risk.</p>
            <p id="bottom-space">Entire livelihoods, cattle and farmland are destroyed, leaving people with absolutely
